* CDN migration: Initiated CDN migration of Binge offnet users traffic from Nexdecade CDN servers (third-party) to Robi own CDN servers. This migration will result in annual savings of 80Mn BDT as we reduce our reliance on third party.

* Solving the abnormal otp related SMS issues (2.2 million SMS) and TPS limit exceeded complaints faced by Binge due to growing number of subscriptions by:
  * Getting developers an SMS panel provided by Ada (third-party) for analysis and proper visibility.
  * Ensuring DDOS protection shield is active at application layer to block brute force attacks by hackers.
  * Ensure proper blocking mechanisms are in place to block numbers that are generating multiple SMS (i.e., blocking mechanism implemented for a MSISDN is simultaneous 10 requests in a min)
* Contributed to IT Simplification Project (Robi CIO action item) to save costs by itentifying VM/hardware resources that can be offloaded. As Robi was facing resource crunch in Pubail DC, to help in this resource crunch problem, found out which Binge VM resources utilization was low for the last one year and can be offloaded. Hence, some VMs were offloaded freeing up around 2.22 TB space. This contributed BDT 6 million savings to IT Simplification Project of NCP team.
