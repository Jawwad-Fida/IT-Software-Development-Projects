### [Binge - Online video streaming OTT platform (binge.buzz)](https://binge.buzz/) - ðŸ“˜ Robi's OTT Platform
Binge is an online video streaming OTT (Over-the-top) platform that offers endless entertainment in the form of Live TV, web series, films, dramas, movies, Binge Exclusive Originals and much more. Binge provides a truly seamless entertainment experience to customers where they can watch as much as they want, whenever they want, without a single commercial. Binge is Robi's owned streaming platform has been successfully running from 2021. Binge brings a wide variety of contents from: Live TV, web series, films, dramas, movies, Video-On-Demand to Binge Exclusive Originals. It is currently available 100+ countries all over the world. Binge is currently available in IOS, Android, Large Screen, Web.

What is there in Binge:
 Enjoy variety of Exclusive Web Series, ranging from thriller to romantic comedy.
* Stream exciting, diverse contents available exclusively for you.
* Play, pause, and resume watching your favorite contents, without watching a single commercial.
* Usage History feature to help you see how much time you've spent on Binge, every day.
* Flexible subscription payment methods for you to have full control over preferred mode of payment.
* Enable Parental lock feature to restrict specific content for your kids. AND MORE!

**Some Notable Achivements**: 
* On Net Free & Off net premium feature delivery: On Net Free & Off net premium feature for both Android and iOS Mobile. All On Net customers (Robi Network customers) will be able to watch all content without purchasing any SVOD pack. All Off Net customers (other telecoms) will have to purchase subscriptions to watch premium content. All free content will be available to both On Net & Off net customers as per usual.
* CDN migration: Initiated CDN migration of Binge offnet users traffic from Nexdecade CDN servers (third-party) to Robi own CDN servers. This migration will result in annual savings of 80Mn BDT as we reduce our reliance on third party.
* Initiated Binge SaaS/Turnkey Solution which will optimize cost by BDT 54.14Mn per quarter i.e., BDT 216.53 Mn in 4 quarters mainly via this model.
* Solving the abnormal otp related SMS issues (2.2 million SMS) and TPS limit exceeded complaints faced by Binge due to growing number of subscriptions by:
  * Getting developers an SMS panel provided by Ada (third-party) for analysis and proper visibility.
  * Ensuring DDOS protection shield is active at application layer to block brute force attacks by hackers.
  * Ensure proper blocking mechanisms are in place to block numbers that are generating multiple SMS (i.e., blocking mechanism implemented for a MSISDN is simultaneous 10 requests in a min)
* Contributed to IT Simplification Project (Robi CIO action item) to save costs by itentifying VM/hardware resources that can be offloaded. As Robi was facing resource crunch in Pubail DC, to help in this resource crunch problem, found out which Binge VM resources utilization was low for the last one year and can be offloaded. Hence, some VMs were offloaded freeing up around 2.22 TB space. This contributed BDT 6 million savings to IT Simplification Project of NCP team.


### [Customer Feedback Management (CFM)](https://cfm.robi.com.bd/) - ðŸ“˜ Robi's central feedback management solution
CFM is a self-sustained, real-time, human independent feedback management system that automates the collection and management of customer feedback from different customer service channels into daily business operations. CFM solution will enable Robi to manage customer feedbacks centrally from a single platform. The solution will integrate and collect feedback from multiple touch points/integration points (i.e. almost all Robi and Airtel customer facing/service channels) using survey, web form, and social media channel and consolidate all the feedback into a single dashboard. When a customer will interact with any of the channel (fulfils an interaction purpose), customer will get a survey to rate performance of the hit channel. This solution is designed to collect customers feedback, analyze feedback based on different criteria and act depending on customer feedback with the goal to optimize the customer experience. CFM solution also includes intuitive dashboard along with reporting that will provide clear visibility of the whole Robi and Airtel (another Robi brand) customers on their level of satisfaction and areas to improve.

Key Deliverables: 
* Survey Management portal.
* Channel Integration
* Reporting portal.
* Infrastructure readiness.
* OS Layer Readiness for Application.
* Integration with MS AD.

Key Benefits:
* Implementation of CFM Solution in Robi will facilitate to comply the Group direction (Axiata Corporate Center) to all Opcos for implementing tNPS (Transactional NPS) solution for customer service channels in a uniformed way.
* Automate & Digitalize Feedback Mgt. Process and improve CX Satisfaction at Interaction channels.
* Centralized Survey Management
* Feedback Closed Feedback Loop
* Optimized Customer Experience
* Visibility of Customer Experience & Improvement Areas

### [Orchestrator RPA](https:#) - ðŸ“˜ Centralized platform to monitor and control Robi's RPA (Robotic Process Automation) bots
Robi Axiata Limited several RPAs in place with a variety of functions in various departments. When these RPA servers go down, the entire workflow becomes stalled, which can only be rectified by manually restarting the RPA via the command prompt. Hence, without the trouble of command prompt, a centralized hub with numerous functionalities such as enable, disable, start, off, schedule, multi-scheduling of these RPA was required to handle this issue. As a result, a centralized system called Orchestrator RPA can be incorporated to manage and monitor all RPA processes in the organization. This is a web application that manages the execution of recurring tasks. This online interactive digitized solution Orchestrator RPA will  erase all obscures and enhance to rectify in an user friendly manner.  Overall, It is a single control room where users can plan and run bots on desktop and virtual machines, create sequences, monitor bot status, and analyze the results of their work. 

Key Features:
* Role based User Access Management.
* RPA (Robotic Process Automation) Onboarding.
* Log report of each RPA.
* Scheduling (One-time schedule, Multi-schedule, Enable/Disable).
* Real-time Notification.

Key Deliverables: 
* Role based User Access Management.
* RPA (Robotic Process Automation) Onboarding.
* Log report of each RPA.
* Scheduling (One-time schedule, Multi-schedule, Enable/Disable).
* Real-time Notification.
* ELK Integration.

Key Benefits:
* In-house built; Using a third-party orchestrator can be very expensive.
* All RPA logs can be seen from this solution; No need to login into ELK for log analysis.
* Perfect solution for low-level automation in comparison with the market applications.
