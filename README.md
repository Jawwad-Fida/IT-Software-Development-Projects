### [Binge - Online video streaming OTT platform (binge.buzz)](https://binge.buzz/) - ðŸ“˜ Robi's OTT Platform
Binge is an online video streaming OTT (Over-the-top) platform that offers endless entertainment in the form of Live TV, web series, films, dramas, movies, Video-On-Demand to Binge Exclusive Originals and much more. Binge provides a truly seamless entertainment experience to customers where they can watch as much as they want, whenever they want, without a single commercial. Binge is Robi's owned streaming platform.  It is currently available 100+ countries all over the world. Binge is currently available in IOS, Android, Large Screen, Web.
Content Language: English, Bangla.

**Some Notable Achivements**: 
* On Net Free & Off net premium (Android and IOS): On Net customers (Robi Telecom customers) will be able to watch all content without purchasing any SVOD pack. All Off Net customers (other telecom customers) will have to purchase subscriptions to watch premium content. All free content will be available to both On Net & Off net customers as per usual.
* CDN migration: Initiated CDN migration of Binge offnet users traffic from Nexdecade CDN servers (third-party) to Robi own internal CDN servers. This migration will result in annual savings of 80Mn BDT for Robi as the company reduces reliance on third party.
* Technical project management and cross-platform integration during the complete in-house overhaul of company's OTT platform (binge.buzz), which resulted in significant cost savings of 112.32 mBDT (1.14 mUSD) per year by streamlining operations and consolidating services under one internal DevOps team, thereby reducing the complexity of Binge ecosystem.
* Solving the abnormal otp related SMS issues (2.2 million SMS) and TPS limit exceeded complaints faced by Binge due to growing number of subscriptions by: Ensuring DDOS protection shield is active at application layer to block brute force attacks by hackers, and Ensuring proper blocking mechanisms are in place to block numbers that are generating multiple SMS (i.e., implementing blocking mechanism for a MSISDN to simultaneous 10 requests in a min)
* Contributed to IT Simplification Project (Robi CIO action item) to save costs by itentifying VM/hardware resources that can be offloaded. As Robi was facing resource crunch in its data center, to help in this resource crunch problem, I found out which Binge VM resources utilization was low for the last one year and can be offloaded. Hence, some VMs were offloaded freeing up around 2.22 TB space. This contributed BDT 6 mBDT (54,546 mUSD) per year savings to IT Simplification Project from my end.

### [Orchestrator RPA](https:#) - ðŸ“˜ Centralized platform to monitor and control Robi's RPA (Robotic Process Automation) bots
Robi Axiata Limited several RPAs in place with a variety of functions in various departments. When these RPA servers go down, the entire workflow becomes stalled, which can only be rectified by manually restarting the RPA via the command prompt. Hence, without the trouble of command prompt, a centralized hub with numerous functionalities such as enable, disable, start, off, schedule, multi-scheduling of these RPA was required to handle this issue. As a result, a centralized system called Orchestrator RPA can be incorporated to manage and monitor all RPA processes in the organization. This is a web application that manages the execution of recurring tasks. This online interactive digitized solution Orchestrator RPA will  erase all obscures and enhance to rectify in an user friendly manner.  Overall, It is a single control room where users can plan and run bots on desktop and virtual machines, create sequences, monitor bot status, and analyze the results of their work.

**A Notable Achivement**: 
* Contributed to IT Simplification Project (Robi CIO action item) to save costs by itentifying VM/hardware resources that can be offloaded. There were multiple RPAs no longer being used by Business team. Hence, the RPAs were offloaded and the server was decommissioned as it was no longer required. Also, scheduling time of RPAs was assessed, and the RPAs that had no conflict in scheduling time were brought together into a single server, thus reducing more resources. Total space freed up is 850 GB.
